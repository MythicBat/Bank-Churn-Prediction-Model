Description: In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a bank. By analyzing historical data, the model identifies patterns that suggest whether a customer is likely to leave the bank. The goal is to help the bank take proactive steps to retain at-risk customers and improve overall customer satisfaction.

Key Highlights:

a) Utilized a dataset containing various customer attributes such as tenure, credit score, balance, and active accounts.

b) Preprocessed the data for quality, handling missing values, and normalizing features.

c) Built and compared multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to identify the most effective model.

d) Achieved a high accuracy and F1-score, indicating a strong performance in identifying customers likely to churn.

e) Provided actionable insights that can be used by the bank to design customer retention strategies.

Technologies Used:
1. Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
2. Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and model development
3. Data visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

This project showcases my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation in the context of real-world business challenges.
